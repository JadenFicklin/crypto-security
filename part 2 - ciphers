my cipher will associate a number with each of the letters in the alphabet spanning 1-26 but multiplied by 20 and spread backwards and then devided by 924
spaces will be the "#" symbol

for example 
"hello" 

would go from
"8, 5, 12, 15, 15"
to
"160, 100, 240, 240, 300"
to
"300, 240, 240, 100, 160"
to
"0.3246753246753247, 0.2597402597402597, 0.2597402597402597, 0.1082251082251082, 0.1731601731601732"
